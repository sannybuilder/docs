# Introduction

**Sanny Builder** is a fast and powerful tool designed for the GTA 3D game series (GTA3, VC, SA, LCS, VCS).

It includes a disassembler, permitting the end-user to transform the game scripts into text. The compiler feature offers a convenient editor with a large number of [useful functions](editor/features.md) such as syntax highlighting, error checking, advanced search tools, player coordinates reading, fast movement through code and much more.

Sanny offers an advanced code syntax which is similar to existing programming languages. This syntax includes changeable [classes](language/instructions/classes.md), [keywords ](language/instructions/keywords.md)and high-level statements. We recommend you continue reading and fully explore the documentation to learn more about SB and its capabilities. We provide a wealth of information that will help you get started in mission coding.

## **Installation and Updates**

Run the installer and follow its instructions. During installation you could optionally select the game directory you plan to work with, associate files with the `.scm` extension with Sanny Builder and install the [CLEO library](https://cleo.li).  You can always update these settings in the [program options](editor/options/).

To uninstall the program, run the file `unins000.exe` located in its root folder.

Latest versions and updates are always available on [sannybuilder.com](https://sannybuilder.com/)
