# Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which [instructions](../instructions/) in a script are executed. A default order is sequential from the top of the script. It can be changed using control flow statements: [loops](loops.md), [conditions](conditions.md), [switches](switch.md), or [jumps](labels.md).
