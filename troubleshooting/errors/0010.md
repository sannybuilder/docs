# 0010: Unknown opcode

The compiler finds an opcode that has not been defined in the [INI file](../../edit-modes/opcodes-list-scm.ini.md).

**Possible solutions:** update the code to use the known opcode. If you're sure this opcode exists, update opcode definitions or use the [`$OPCODE`](../../language/directives.md#usdopcode) directive to let the compiler know how to compile it.
