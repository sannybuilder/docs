# 0013: Unknown directive

The compiler finds an unknown or unexpected command. It can be some gibberish word at the start of a line where the compiler expects an opcode or a [keyword](../../language/instructions/keywords.md).

**Possible solutions:** edit the command in question, probably there is a typo.
