# 0017: Unknown type of variable

The compiler can't recognize the type of a variable. In most cases, it happens as the variable is not declared, or is declared with another type.

**Possible solutions:** [give](../../language/data-types/variables.md#declaring-a-variable-type) the variable a type using the `var` keyword
