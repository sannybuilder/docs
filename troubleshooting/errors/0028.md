# 0028: Unterminated string

The compiler can't find the end of the [string literal](../../coding/data-types.md#string-literals). String literals must be enclosed in quotes (double `"` or single `'`, depending on the string type). Note that quotes in the literal's content must be escaped.

**Possible solutions:** add a missing quote.
