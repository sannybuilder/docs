# 0029: Invalid debug script ID

The compiler can't read the parameter value of the opcode `05B6`, or the value is not a number. 

This opcode references a chunk of debug data left by the game developers. This data is cached in `*.bin` files in the Sanny Builder directory. It has no special meaning in runtime and is left in the disassembled code only to preserve one-to-one match with the original script.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since v3.6 Sanny Builder deprecates the old form of this opcode with a single number parameter in favor of the new `k` [type](../../edit-modes/opcodes-list-scm.ini.md#parameter-types). Now this instruction accepts a string literal enclosed in double quotes:

```
05B6: 1 // before v3.6
05B6: "some string" // after v3.6
```

Similar opcodes in SA Mobile have been updated too:

```
0A66: write_log "Mission Page 0" 
0A67: write_log_int 15@ 15@ 15@ "taking money off player" 
0A68: write_log_float 10@ 10@ 10@ "debug" 
0A6E: set_widget_texture 54 "hud_check" 
```

**Possible solutions:** use the number produced by the disassembler, or delete this opcode from the script.
