# 0038: Unknown type of array

The compiler finds an array element whose [type](../../language/data-types/arrays.md#general-syntax) is unknown.

**Possible solutions:** use one of the known array types: integer (`i`), float (`f`) or string (`s` or `v`):

```
0@(10@,4h) // error, 'h' is unknown
0@(10@,4i) // OK, 'i' is known
```
