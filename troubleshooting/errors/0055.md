# 0055: Identifier not found

The compiler can't resolve the identifier (a [variable](../../language/data-types/variables.md) name, [constant](../../language/data-types/constants.md) value, etc) as it's missing or is invalid.

**Possible solutions:** write the correct identifier:

```
00A5: 0@ = create_car # at 0.0 0.0 0.0 // error, model name not found
00A5: 0@ = create_car #PONY at 0.0 0.0 0.0 // OK
```
