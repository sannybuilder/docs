# 0055: Identifier not found

The compiler can't resolve the identifier \(a [variable](../../coding/variables.md) name, [constant](../../coding/constants.md) value, etc\) as it's missing or is invalid.

**Possible solutions:** write the correct identifier:

```text
00A5: 0@ = create_car # at 0.0 0.0 0.0 // error, model name not found
00A5: 0@ = create_car #PONY at 0.0 0.0 0.0 // OK
```
