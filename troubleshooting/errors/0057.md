# 0057: Internal label not found

The compiler fails to compile a high-level statement (such as [IF..THEN..END](../../language/control-flow/conditions.md#high-level-constructs), [WHILE..END](../../language/control-flow/loops.md), etc). In most cases it happens if the statement does not have a closing `end` word.

**Possible solutions:** check the statement syntax in the script and make sure each of them properly ends.
