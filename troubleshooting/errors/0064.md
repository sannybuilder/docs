# 0064: Mission label not found

The compiler can't find the starting [label](../../language/data-types/#labels) of a mission.

**Possible solutions:** make sure that each mission declared in the header exists in the source file. Either add a missed mission, or remove the declaration:

```
DEFINE MISSIONS 1
DEFINE MISSION 0 AT @MISSION_0

:MAIN

// error, MISSION_0 not found 
```
