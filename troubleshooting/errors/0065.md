# 0065: External script label not found

The compiler can't find the starting [label](../../language/data-types/#labels) of an external script.

**Possible solutions:** make sure that each external script declared in the header exists in the source file. Either add a missed script, or remove the declaration:

```
DEFINE MISSIONS 1
DEFINE MISSION 0 AT @MISSION_0

DEFINE EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS 2
DEFINE SCRIPT TEST AT @SCRIPT
DEFINE SCRIPT TEST2 AT @SCRIPT2

DEFINE UNKNOWN_EMPTY_SEGMENT 0
DEFINE UNKNOWN_THREADS_MEMORY 0

:MAIN

:MISSION_0

:SCRIPT

// error, SCRIPT2 not found
```
