# 0072: Missing logical operator

A [conditional statement](../../language/control-flow/conditions.md) has multiple conditions but a required logical operator (**AND** or **OR**) is missing.

**Possible solutions:** change the statement by either keeping only one condition or adding the operator **AND** or **OR:**

```
if
  0@ == 1
  1@ == 1  // error, logical operator is missing
then
  //
end

if and
  0@ == 1
  1@ == 1  // OK
then
  //
end

if or
  0@ == 1
  1@ == 1  // OK
then
  //
end

if
  0@ == 1  // OK
then
  //
end
```
