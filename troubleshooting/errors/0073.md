# 0073: Redundant logical operator

A logical operator (**AND** or **OR**) has been applied to a single condition in the [conditional statement](../../language/control-flow/conditions.md). A logical operator is only needed where there are multiple conditions. It may signal a possible error that some conditions were missing.

**Possible solutions:** change this statement by either adding missing conditions, or getting rid of the operator:

```
if and
  0@ == 1 // error, AND is used for a single condition
then
  //
end

if
  0@ == 1 // OK
then
  //
end

if and
  0@ == 1
  1@ == 1 // OK
then
  //
end
```
