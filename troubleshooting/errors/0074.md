# 0074: Disabled option

The compiler finds a [conditional statement](../../language/control-flow/conditions.md) with a logical operator (**AND** or **OR**) but the required `Check conditions` [option](../../editor/options/general.md#check-conditions) is turned off. Using logical operators is only allowed when this option is enabled.

**Possible solutions:** enable `Check conditions` in the [options](../../editor/options/general.md) or replace the operator with an [appropriate](../../language/control-flow/conditions.md#low-level-if-statements) integer number:

```
if and    // error, option disabled
    0@ == 1
    1@ == 1
then
    //
end

if 1    // OK
    0@ == 1
    1@ == 1
then
    //
end
```
