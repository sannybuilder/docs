# 0083: Unknown model ID

The compiler is unable to resolve the model id using the `.ide` files configured for the current [edit mode](https://docs.sannybuilder.com/edit-modes#ide).

It may happen in a header-less script (e.g. a CLEO script or any script compiled with the `{$EXTERNAL}` [directive](../../language/directives.md#usdexternal)) where all models must be compiled with their in-game id.

**Possible solutions:** use a model id instead of the name. To find the id use the Sanny's built-in [conversion tool](../../editor/options/hotkeys.md) (`Ctrl+Alt+H`):

```
{$CLEO}

0107: $o = create_object #KEYCARD at 0 0 0 // error, can't find KEYCARD
0107: $o = create_object 1581 at 0 0 0 // OK
```

If the the edit mode references `.ide` files from the game directory make sure this directory is set in the [options](../../editor/options/general.md#game-directory).
