# 0084: Jump to offset 0

A header-less script has a control-flow statement that transfers the control to the [label](../../language/data-types/#labels) before the first command in the script.

Either `jump 0` or `jump_if_false 0` would represent such a statement. The game considers numbers that are greater than or equal to `0` as global offsets so it continues executing commands from the beginning of the `main.scm`. On the other hand negative numbers represent offsets that are relative to the start of the current script.

A visible effect of this bug is that the game "reloads" (as if a new game started).

**Possible solutions:** add opcode `0000:` as the very first command to shift the following commands and allow the compiler to represent all offsets with negative numbers:

```
{$CLEO}
while true
    wait 0
end // error, jump to offset 0


{$CLEO}
0000:
while true
    wait 0
end // OK, jump to offset -2
```

If you need to bypass the compiler check use commands `jump 0` or `jump_if_false 0`.
