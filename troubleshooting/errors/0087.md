# 0087: Invalid variable

The compiler finds an `ADMA` [variable](../../language/data-types/#variables) that is not a multiple of `4` and the [edit mode](../../edit-modes/) targets Liberty City Stories or Vice City Stories.

Data types in these games only allow addressing variables storage by offsets that are multiples of `4`.

**Possible solutions:** change the variable to be a multiple of `4`:&#x20;

```
&3 = 0 // error
&4 = 0 // OK
```
