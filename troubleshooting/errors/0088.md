# 0088: Global variable is out of range

A [global variable](../../coding/variables.md#global-variables) does not fit in the [allowed range](../../scm-documentation/gta-limits.md).

You can use global variables in the range from `$2` to `$3FFF` in GTA III, VC and San Andreas. The maximum variable is `$6655` in Liberty City Stories,  and`$6399` in Vice City Stories.

**Possible solutions:** change the variable name to be a positive integer value in the allowed range for the given game. Alternatively you may disable the [option](../../options/general.md#ranges-check) `Ranges check`.
