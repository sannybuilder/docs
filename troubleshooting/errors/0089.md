# 0089: Opcode not found

The compiler finds an opcode that is not available among the standard opcodes \(available with vanilla game\) and the current script [extensions](../../edit-modes/extensions.md).

**Possible solutions:** add [directive](../../coding/directives.md#usduse) `{$USE <extension_name>}` where `<extension_name>` is one of the [available extensions](../../edit-modes/extensions.md#extensions-list) defining the opcode.

For example, opcode `0BA2` in GTA III is only available with CLEO 2.0 and MemoryModule plugin. In order to make you aware of this extra dependency the compiler throws this error if it can't find `{$USE memory}`. For existing scripts adding this directive will be a one-time change and the script continues to compile. 

```text
{$USE memory}
```

If you're unsure which extension the opcode belongs to, open the file `extensions.txt` in the edit mode's directory \(`Sanny Builder\data\<edit mode>\extensions.txt`\) and locate it there.
