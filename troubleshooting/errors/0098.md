# 0098: Unknown operator

The compiler found an unknown character sequence where a valid [operator](../../language/instructions/expressions.md) was expected.

#### Possible solutions:

* Check the syntax and provide a known and valid operator. Valid operators are: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `<>`, `+=`, `-=,` `*=`, `/=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `~=`, `%=`, `>>=`, `<<=`, `#=`, `+=@`, `-=@`.
