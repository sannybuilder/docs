# 0099: Left-hand side of the assignment must be a variable

Compiler expected one or more variables on the left-hand side of the assignment but found something else. For example, this would be an error:

```c
5 = 6
```

#### Possible solutions:

* check your assignment statement and provide a variable which will store the value.

```c
int x = 5
```

* if right-hand side of the assignment returns multiple values, left-hand side should have the same number of variables, delimited by commas:

```c
float x, y, z
x, y, z = Char.GetCoordinates(10@) // store X-, Y-, and Z- coordinates in three variables
```
