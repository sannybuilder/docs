# 0100: Invalid operator

Compiler found an operator that is not supported in the current context. At the moment this error is being thrown when anything other than the [assignment operator](../../language/instructions/expressions.md#assignment) `=` is used after the list of variables:

```c
int a, b

a, b > 5 // error, > is invalid
```

#### Possible solutions:

* check your expression. Use the `=` operator after a comma-separated list of variables:

```c
int a, b

a, b = Car.GetColors(car)
```

* use one variable with other operators:

```c
int a, b

a > 5
b > 5
```
