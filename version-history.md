`var = Audiostream.Load3D(file_name)`

## v. 2.99d - 03.12.2006

{% hint style="info" %}
If you get a compiler error message like `Unknown directive xxxx` when compiling the sources from v2.99, replace the line `{$VERSION xxxx}` to any place after the header, for instance before the comment `//-------------MAIN---------------`
{% endhint %}

## v. 2.99 - 27.09.2006

* added new commands `WriteMem` and `ReadMem`
* support for [hexadecimal](language/data-types/#hexadecimal-numbers) numbers
* `HEX..END` statement accepts labels and global variables
* full support for the [ADMA](language/data-types/#variables) datatype
* an opportunity to give [custom names](editor/options/formats.md#custom-names) to labels
* an opportunity to choose a [different case](editor/options/formats.md#case-converting) for custom names and strings
* added [console](editor/console.md) to switch debug options
* decompiler supports `GXT` files of GTA III & GTA VC
* added escape sequences in [long string literals](language/data-types/#string-literals)
* information about [INI](edit-modes/opcodes-list-scm.ini.md) file (version, author, date)
* classes support the original order of the parameters (like in `SASCM.INI` by PLPynton). The script should have a line {`$VERSION x.0.xxxx`} to support such order, see comments in the `INI` about this

* reading/writing of the player's z\_angle in [Coord Manager](editor/features.md#player-coordinates-management); quick insertion of the z\_angle value in the script by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+E` (for SA)

{% hint style="info" %}
The following opcodes were changed in `SASCM.INI`: `0181`, `00c3`, `00c4` in order to support the commands `WriteMem` and `ReadMem`. The original scripts did not use these opcodes and the unmodified games do not implement them so it should not break existing scripts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The class member `Car.SetSpeedInstantly` was named incorrectly (with a wrong opcode) in the `classes.db` for SA. If you get an error message about this method during compilation, rename it to`Actor.DrivingPlane`. We apologize.
{% endhint %}
